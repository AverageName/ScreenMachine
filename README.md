# ScreenMachine

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```      

From console:     
``` python screenmachine.py --time="your period with which you want to send screens" ```   

OR:    
Rename screenmachine.py to screenmachine.pyw (for Windows)       
Click on it and it will run in background      
Don't forget to hardcode args.time in this case.
