# ScreenMachine

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```      

From console:
``` python screenmachine.py --time="your period with which you want to send screens" ```   

OR:
Rename screenmachine.py to screenmachine.pyw (for Windows) and just click on it and it will run in background
Don't forget to hardcode args.time in this case.
